        <h3>Sacrament Meeting</h3>
        <p>We happily announce a move to higher Sacrament meeting attendance starting a week from tomorrow, on Sunday,
            January 17th. With county and state COVID restrictions being moved to level orange, we will begin allowing
            120
            members to attend in person Sacrament meeting each week. This effectively allows those who desire to attend
            in
            person, the opportunity at least twice each month. We recognize that not all will feel comfortable meeting
            in
            person. This continues to be optional. Zoom broadcasts will continue weekly and the authorization to
            administer
            the Sacrament in individual home, is still allowed by the proper priesthood authority. </p>

        <h3>Young Men & Women's Activites</h3>
        <p>We are trying to get on a fairly set schedule for youth nights. They will be held on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays
            of
            each month starting at 7pm. With that said, we altered our January schedule to align with both school
            holidays
            as well as, Stake events so our 2nd night for January will be held this coming Tuesday, the 26th. We will be
            having a youth "All About Me" night at the church starting at 7pm. We encourage families to support their
            youth
            in attending on a regular basis. </p>

        <p>For those unaware, the 2021 Trek has been canceled by the church. We are planning on having a stay at home
            ward
            youth conference June 10-12th so mark your calendars for those dates. </p>
