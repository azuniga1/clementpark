                <p>It is with great pleasure we announce two wonderful opportunities to start our return back to
                    normalcy at
                    church on Sundays
                <p>Starting Sunday, February 21st singing (with masks still on) will be allowed in our
                    meetings. We will be
                    blessed as we return to a wonderful form of worship as we sing, opening and closing hymns, as well
                    as
                    the Sacrament hymn.</p>

                <p>We will also move back into 2nd hour classes offered at the church
                    building. Please watch for more specific details to be released next week, but please plan on the
                    following:
                    Sacrament meeting will be from 10:00-10:50am
                    The ward will still be divided in half alphbetically for attendance every other week
                    2nd hour classes will be held from 11:00-11:30am
                    Classes will be available for adults, youth as well as primary</p>

                <p>We are trying to get on a fairly set schedule for youth nights. They will be held on the 1st and 3rd
                    Tuesdays of each month starting at 7pm. We encourage families to support their youth in attending on
                    a
                    regular basis. </p>

                <p>For those unaware, the 2021 Trek has been canceled by the church. We are planning on having a stay at
                    home ward youth conference June 10-12th so mark your calendars for those dates. </p>
